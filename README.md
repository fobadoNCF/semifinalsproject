Develop a simple Airline Seat Reservation using a specific language with File I/O Implementation for Data Storage.

Minimum Modules:
> Display seats - displays the seats of a 20 x 4 capacity air-bus; It also shows those that are already reserved and those that are not.

> Reserve seat/s - ability to update one or more seats at once; There must be a checking whether the preferred seat is already taken, to prevent double-reservation of a seat.

> Cancel reservation - ability to remove reserved seat/s to simulate cancellation; There must be a confirmation to prevent auto-removal of seat/s.

> Transfer seat/s - ability to transfer an existing seat reservation to another another position; There must be a checking whether the new preferred seat is already taken, to prevent double-reservation of a seat.

Other constraints:
> Use of Linked-list or Array of Objects is highly required.

Deliverables:
> Source Code - link to a GIT repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket, etc)

> Short Video with voice over to explain the algorithm, source code, and sample run and output.
